Hey there, this is my code of learning Swift on Standfors CS193p class. I will keep post it during my learning time, and by the way, due to now, I have some issue about my calculator app. It just crased and say "Thread 1: signal SIGABRT" error. I'm very confused about that, so, if you can solve the problem, you can pull your solution on the issue pages. I appricieate your working.

Thanks a lot again!
